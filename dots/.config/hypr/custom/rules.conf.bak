# Opacity Variables - Managed by illogical-impulse
# Use these variables in your window rules:
# windowrulev2 = opacity $OPACITY_ACTIVE override $OPACITY_INACTIVE override, class:^(yourapp)$
$OPACITY_ACTIVE = 1
$OPACITY_INACTIVE = 1
# End Opacity Variables

# You can put custom rules here
# Window/layer rules: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Window-Rules/
# Workspace rules: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Workspace-Rules/
